# UI Components

The goal of this page is to present and reference different reusable UI 
components in the project, and detail their usage.

## MenuBox

This component is a basic UI component for displaying a floating box, and 
displaying it only when a condition is met.

<Playground>
  { () => {
  const [activated, setActivated] = useState(false)
  return (
  <MenuBox activate={activated}>
    <button
      onClick={() => { setActivated(!activated) }}
    >
      Click me to open a box
    </button>
    <MenuBoxContent>
      <p> I'm the content of the box ! </p>
    </MenuBoxContent>
  </MenuBox>
  )}}
</Playground>
