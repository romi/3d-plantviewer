# 3D view interactors

## Types of interactors

If you're launched the app and opened a plant reconstruction, you noticed there 
are some interactors in the 3d view. Some enable or disable layers, other make
color pickers or other tools appear (with the help of a
[MenuBox](/Components/UI#menubox) for example).

Here's a quick summary of each type of interactors:

### Camera

These 2 interactors are in the center and control the display of 
cameras in 3D space. The second one resets the 3D view.

### Layers

Those are what controls the display of the different layers of the 3D view.

### Tools

Those are displayed below the layers, and contain some tools related to each
corresponding layer, for example color pickers for each layer.

### Misc

Those are on the right and contain miscellaneous tools like background color
or the snapshot tool.

### Overlay

This is a special set of interactors. Designed to display stuff on top of the 
3D view, at the time of writing this, it only manages the bubbles that appear 
when clicking on an organ.

## Interactor

### Description

The `Interactor` component is the basic interactive building block of those 
buttons.

### Props

<Props of={DocInteractor} />

### Example

<Playground>
  { () => {
    const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
    return <Interactor
      activated={active}
      onClick={() => { setActive(!active) }}
    />
  }}
</Playground>

This example is simply an interactor that toggles from active to inactive
when clicking on it. Interactors are basically a button, of course, it needs
to be associated with things like [MenuBox](/Components/UI#menubox)
