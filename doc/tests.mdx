# Writing tests

## Technologies used

Since this app is React based, the most appropriate testing framework (at least 
when the tests were first written) is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), associated
with the 
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

Of course, make sure you understand those frameworks before trying to write 
tests, they're pretty annoying sometimes, but there isn't many alternatives.

## Test structure

Each test file must be placed alongside the code file it's supposed to test, 
and have the same name with a `.test` before the `.js`.

For exemple, if I want to create a test file to test `exampleComponent.js` in 
the `components/` directory, i'll create the test file 
`exampleComponent.test.js` in the same directory.

## Running tests

To run tests, simply run the following command:

```
npm run test
```

Feel free to read [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for
more information.

## Writing tests

### Imports

To test things, don't use the imports from `react-testing-library`, but import
those functions from `rd/tools/test-utils.js`. The reason is that this import
has a wrapper instead, which ensures the components are renders correctly.

### Good practices

When writing tests, try to reuse code as much as possible by using the
beforeEach, beforeAll, and other functions provided by Jest.

Use describe blocks to organize tests in logical parts (of course, you don't 
need to use describe blocks if it's very small tests, or if it doesn't make a 
lot of sense to use them).

## Continous integration

At the time of writing this documentation, continous integration is
setup to trigger on push and pull request on the master branch.
Try to write tests for every component you write to make the app more
robust.
