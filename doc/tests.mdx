# Writing tests

## Technologies used

Since this app is React based, the most appropriate testing framework (at least 
when the tests were first written) is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), associated
with the 
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).

Of course, make sure you understand those frameworks before trying to write 
tests, they're pretty annoying sometimes, but there isn't many alternatives.

## Test structure

Each test file must be placed alongside the code file it's supposed to test, 
and have the same name with a `.test` before the `.js`.

For exemple, if I want to create a test file to test `exampleComponent.js` in 
the `components/` directory, i'll create the test file 
`exampleComponent.test.js` in the same directory.

## Running tests

To run tests, simply run the following command:

```
npm run test
```

Feel free to read [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for
more information.

## Continous integration

At the time of writing this documentation, continous integration is
setup to trigger on push and pull request on the master branch.
Try to write tests for every component you write to make the app more
robust.
