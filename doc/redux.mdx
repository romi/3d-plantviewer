# Redux store

## About Redux

As mentionned in the [technologies used section](/#technologies-used), this 
application uses Redux for its state management, it is recommended that you 
check out Redux if you don't know how it works to better understand this section
and the app as a whole.

## Store structure

The Redux store of the visualizer is divided into 3 main sections:

### Interactions
  
This part of the store contains information about the state of
user controls and the 3D view.

The initial state of this store is the following:
  
<ObjectFormatter object={initialState} />


### Scans

This part of the store contains sorting, search, and filtering information for
the home page (the list of scans).

The initial state is the following:

<ObjectFormatter object={scansState} />

What might be more interesting is the list of available sorting methods:

<ObjectFormatter object={sortingMethods} />

### Settings

This last part of the store contains settings informations, for example, which 
layers are currently displayed, or which tool is currently active.

The initial state is the following:

<ObjectFormatter object={settingsState} />
