# Fetching data

This section is dedicated to explain how to make requests to the server
in order to fetch the data necessary to display scans.

## Introduction

Most of the things related to server requests are based in `flow/scans`. There 
are a bunch of hooks there made to fetch data from the server.

The next sections explains and describes what each hook does.
